# JavaScript bind() Lab

## Overview

In this lab, you'll use and be able to identify when to use `bind()`. 

## Tick, tock...

That's it. We've had to repair this old clock too many times now. Let's create a digital one instead!
 
1. Create an object called `digitalClock`
2. This object should have two properties:
    1. `time`: the current time in _seconds_, rounded off (Hint: take a look at `Date`)
    2. `startTicking`: a method that increases the `time` property with one second every second. Use `.bind()` or ES2015 arrow functions to correctly set the property!

## So much for free speech

Let's automate the censoring process for Fox TV!

1. Create a function called `censor`. This function takes two arguments: the word being censored, and the string that should be sanitized. Don't worry about case matching for this exercise.
2. The `censor` function should return the input string, with the censored word being replaced with `'BLEEP'`.
3. Create a `violenceCensor` function (using `.bind()` and the `censor()` function) that will censor the word `'violence'`.
4. Create a `drugsCensor` function (using `.bind()` and the `censor()` function) that will censor the word `'drugs'`.
